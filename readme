# Customer Purchase Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning classification system to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

The goal is to understand customer behavior patterns and evaluate multiple classification algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

## 📂 Dataset
**Customer Purchase Behavior Dataset**

Features:
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Number of Purchases
- Product Category
- Time Spent on Website
- Loyalty Program
- Discounts Availed

Target Variable:
- **PurchaseStatus** (0 = No Purchase, 1 = Purchase)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Understanding
- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Inspected structure, shape, and data types

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Purchase vs No Purchase distribution
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature relationship analysis

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Train-test split (80/20)

### 4. Model Building
Implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### 5. Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

### 6. Feature Importance
- Visualized feature importance using Random Forest

---

## 🏆 Results
- Random Forest achieved the best overall performance
- Features like **Annual Income**, **Time Spent on Website**, and **Number of Purchases** were strong predictors

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
