Customer Purchase Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project implements a supervised machine learning system to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on demographic and behavioral data.

The objective is to analyze customer behavior patterns, compare multiple classification algorithms, and identify the most effective model for purchase prediction.

Dataset
Customer Purchase Behavior Dataset

Features
- Age  
- Gender  
- Annual Income  
- Number of Purchases  
- Product Category  
- Time Spent on Website  
- Loyalty Program Membership  
- Discounts Availed  

Target Variable
- PurchaseStatus
  - 0: No Purchase  
  - 1: Purchase  

Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded the dataset using pandas
- Inspected dataset structure, size, and data types

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed the distribution of purchase and non-purchase outcomes
- Visualized correlations between numerical features
- Identified potential patterns influencing purchase behavior

3. Data Preprocessing
- Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
- Applied feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

4. Model Development
The following classification models were implemented:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

5. Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

6. Feature Importance
- Analyzed feature importance using the Random Forest model
- Identified key predictors contributing to purchase decisions


Results
- Random Forest achieved the best overall performance
- Annual Income, Time Spent on Website, and Number of Purchases were strong predictors of purchase behavior
- Ensemble models outperformed individual classifiers on this dataset


Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
